# prototype_recistaurant
ReciStaurant is an improvement to a team project during my masters. In this project I incrementally refactor the code and gradually implement new features. This repository contains only the front-end files.

ReciStaurant is a progressive web app that relies on the google javascript maps api to showcase restaurants around a specified location. The app is mobile responsive.

## Background
The name recistaurant is derived from two words recipe and restaurant. Appending the first 4 letters of recipe to the last 8 letters of restaurant gives us ReciStaurant the S is capitalised showing that it is from another word.

Food is an essential part of our lives, we love to try out new dishes at different places or we prefer to experiment preparing new dishes ourselves at home. Due to this rescistaurant was conceptualised to be a web app with three (3)uses-cases:-

1. Help users find restaurants nearby.
2. Help users find restaurants along a travel path.
3. Help users find a dish recipe's.

Use-case (1) was successfully implemented including ability to add reviews. In this project I will successfully implement use-cases (2) & (3). 

## Progress Report
Below are the features implemented:-
1. Display of map with location marker.
2. Use of google geolocation autocomplete input.
3. Display of restaurant markers on map
